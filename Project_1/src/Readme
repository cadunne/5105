HOW TO COMPILE:

Stay in the p1 directory (where the makefile and this readme reside)

Run "make clean; make" to compile everything
To run the server, simply run "java p1/EchoServer [port]"
To run the clints, run one of the following:
	"java p1/Client_A [hostname] [port]"
	"java p1/Client_B [hostname] [port] [threadCount] [iterationCount]"



Known bugs:
-If you try to push up the iteration count too much, you will get some errors as the log file has been opened too many times
	-Not sure why this happens, because I close the file whenever I write to it, and I also lock it w/ a basic mutex.
